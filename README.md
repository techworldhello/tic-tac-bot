Tic Tac Bot

Admittedly, I started off with a theme in mind and and slowly veered to the result you see now when my original plan didnâ€™t go as planned. And due to time constraint, I decided to go with something that works rather than go down.


Initial plan of attack:

create a board
make grids clickable and assign colours to them
create player turns
store winning combos
match played spots with winning combos
declare winner/draw

Rules:

select one or two player mode
turns are alternated one to one
get 3 grids in a row to win
play away!

Most difficult:

game logic on matching the players' arrays to the nested winning array
building the 'AI' component

Areas to improve:

add a score board
refactor the code (a lot of repetition)
make the borders surrounding the grids unclickable
fix AI's winning message
issue with draw detection 
disable other button when a mode is selected
