Play here :  https://techworldhello.github.io/tic-tac-bot/

Initial plan of attack:

create a board
make grids clickable and assign colours to them
create player turns
store winning combos
match played spots with winning combos
declare winner/draw

Rules:

select one or two player mode
turns are alternated one to one
get 3 grids in a row to win
play away!

Most difficult:

game logic on matching the players' arrays to the nested winning array
building the 'AI' component

Areas to improve:

add a score board
refactor the code (a lot of repetition)
make the borders surrounding the grids unclickable
